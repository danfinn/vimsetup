# Custom vim setup

This is what works for me, maybe it will work for you.  You will need to copy or symlink vimrc to ~/.vimrc

## What's included?

This uses pathogen, syntastic, ag, nerdtree, fugitive, tcomment and a whole slew of color scheme options to pick from.


## Install

cd ~
git clone https://github.com/danfinn/vimsetup .vim
cp .vim/vimrc .vimrc
